* This web app utilizes the Java Spring Boot framework and the React.js JavaScript library
## This app is composed of three parts:
* A React.js frontend UI for displaying data in the browser and styling
* A Spring Boot backend API bridging communication between a database and the UI
* A PostgreSQL database for storing object models which can have CRUD operations performed on them
